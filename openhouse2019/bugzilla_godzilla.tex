\item various interfaces (configurable and localisable)
\end{itemize}

More at {\color{blue}\url{www.bugzilla.org}}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Red Hat products
	\item JBoss products

	\item Community projects
	\item Internal products
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Why bug tracking?}

By tracking you bugs, you can

\begin{itemize}
	\item receive information about a problem
	\item organize your time, plan, and estimate
	\item cooperate with others
	\item share knowledge and ideas
	\item see the progress
	\item find a solution.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why you should think about reporting bugs?}
Reporting bugs is an important activity because
\begin{itemize}
	\item the problem might go unnoticed
	\item you have a unique hardware and setting
	\item a new idea
	\item different needs and expectations
	\item if nobody knows, nothing will change
\end{itemize}
If you report bugs, your will contribute a lot with just a little cost.
\end{frame}

\section{Reporting bugs}

\begin{frame}{What could be a bug?}
You would like to report a bug anytime you find out that something is not right. For example:
\begin{itemize}
	\item a program does not start
	\item keeps crashing
	\item behaves incorrectly
	\item reports errors
	\item has problems with user interface
	\item lacks some features
	\item and more
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{But, is it a bug?}
 When such a problem appears \ldots{} \linebreak can you reproduce it (make it happen again)?

\vspace{15pt}

 {\Large \color{red}If you can, it's probably a bug.}
